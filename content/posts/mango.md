# Mango

_Mangifera indica L._

Mango is an evergreen tree native to southern Asia, imported to the Americas in the sixteenth century. It can be pruned to remain a manageable size, but given the opportunity will grow to 40 meters in height. It bears a delicious sweet oblong fruit which can get to 10" in length, with a thin skin protecting a yellow juicy flesh around a large central seed. 

## Growing Mango

We live on a reforested _finca_ which used to have mango orchards. There is at least one fairly mature tree on our property, though there may be more to find in the jungle.

### Tree Above Workshop

This tree (around 15-20 meters tall) was completely covered in vines when we moved into the house, 12 months before these photos were taken. Around 4 months after our purchase, we had an open air workshop constructured, during which all of the vines were cut. The mango tree is on the side of the shed, and the metal roof of the shed actually encircles the trunk. As the vines died and fell away over the next couple of months, the tree became covered with a flush of new leaves. As we go into dry season we are hoping it will fruit.
