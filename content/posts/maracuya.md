# Maracuya (Passion Fruit)

_Passiflora edulis_.

Passion Fruit, or _Maracuya_ in Spanish, is one of [550 species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passiflora) of the genus Passiflora. Commonly available from farmers markets in Costa Rica, it's a oval yellow fruit, typically around the size of an apple. It has a firm outer shell containing a pulpy/juicy mass fruit and seeds inside. Typically we will cut it in half, scoop out the insides and use them in smoothies, although it's also delicious over yogurt.
